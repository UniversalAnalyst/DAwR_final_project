# Data Analysis with R - Final Project

## Introduction

This document serves as the final project submission for a course on data analysis with R. It utilizes a comprehensive weather dataset from JFK Airport to demonstrate various data analysis techniques.

## Data Preprocessing

The document details the process of selecting, cleaning, converting, and renaming columns pertinent to the analysis. Key variables include precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and pressure.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics and visualizations are employed to explore the relationships between precipitation and other climatological variables. The document also outlines the methodology for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Linear Regression

Simple linear regression models are constructed for each predictor variable. The document illustrates the process of visualizing and evaluating these models using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE.

## Model Improvement

Techniques for enhancing the models are discussed, including the addition of features, regularization, and polynomial components. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted through grid search and cross-validation.

## Model Comparison

A comparative analysis of the different models' performance on the testing set is presented. The document concludes that the regularized multiple linear regression model yields the highest R-squared value and the lowest RMSE.
